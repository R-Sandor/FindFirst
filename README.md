This application sets out to simplify and enrich individuals and teams
knowledge resources such as bookmarks, PDFs, notes, etc. Allowing them to be
searched not only by keyword but semantic meaning.

Create organization to the copious amount of knowledge available, for students,
devs, teachers, and the common person.

## Features

For example when the user arrives to the page they will have a search bar
that is right at the top ready for user to immediately begin doing
full context page searches.

### Quick Reference

### Team Knowledgebase

In this section the bookmarks become the welcome page for new member to share team
knowledge that is relevant to the team.

this solves two problems at once.

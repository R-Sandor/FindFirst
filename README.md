This application sets out to simplify and enrich individuals and teams
knowledge resources such as bookmarks, PDFs, notes, etc. Allowing them to be
searched not only by keyword but semantic meaning.

Create organization to the copious amount of knowledge available, for students,
devs, teachers, and the common person.

## Key Features

### Easy Searching

For example when the user arrives to the page they will have a search bar
that is right at the top ready for user to immediately begin doing
full context page searches.

### Quick Reference

This section shows the bookmarks that are frequently referenced.

### Team Knowledgebase

In this section the bookmarks become the welcome page for new member to share team
knowledge that is relevant to the team.

### RSS Feed from bookmarked sites

Many of the sites a user bookmarks they may also want an RSS feed from,
this solves two problems at once.

### Reading list

A hit list of read later pages.
